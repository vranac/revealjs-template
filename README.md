revealjs-template
=================

Yet another RevealJS setup, but slightly different.
I wanted my presentations to be independent of revealjs, so I decided to try
and setup the revealjs as submodule.

To use this, first clone this repo, then execute
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

If you need to have the npm modules installed locally, you should execute
```
npm install
```

And you should be good to go.
